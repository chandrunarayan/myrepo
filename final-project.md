[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2020_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava/)
# Project Submissions and Final Project

### Goals
* Demonstrate success and learning in p5.js
* Demonstrate knowledge of variables, functions, parameters, conditional statements, loops, and arrays
* Demonstrate the ability to learn and explore new concepts and topics not explored in class
* Demonstrate successful communication and the ability to work with others
* Practice presenting to others

### Prework for All Student Projects
* Generate a list or sketches of your project ideas for apperance and interactivity (Movement, Sound, Colors etc.). It could just be a line drawing in a pad of paper! Upload these to the Github site along with the project and link it to the index.

### Project Specifications

* Each student must push edits/changes to Github multiple times each weekto show that they work on programming consistently
* Your projects must be unique and based on your own ideas, consulting web resources is highly recommended, but make sure your project is not the same as something else you found
* Your project must demonstrate your ability to use variables, functions, parameters, conditional statements, loops, and arrays in your code
* You must conduct at least 2 informal usability sessions, to get user feedback and make changes (this is required content for your final project presentation)
* For the final project, you must work together with your partner, you are welcome to split up work, but you should be connecting frequently and you both must fully understand every aspect of the code
* Your group must show movement forward in your final project each week (you will demo progress on your project to me each week)

### Project Code Submission
* Your code should have a top comment block with your name, last edited date, and a brief description of the entire program
* Each block of code in global, setup and draw should have a comment describing its purpose
* Each function that you created should have a top comment briefly explaining what that function does (note that setup and draw do not need top comments but they will need comments for blocks inside)
* Any complicated parts of your code should have line comments
* Add all of your projects to your Github student portfolios
* Create and submit a video showcasing your final project (this can be anywhere from 2 - 6 minutes, depending on the project). The video should demonstrate a run-through of the program, with a voice talking through what is happening
	* You can record a video, or use screen recording software (I recommend [screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/))
	* Note: You will be evaluated on your ability to tell the story of a user using your project, not on the execution of your video
