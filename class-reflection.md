# Class Reflection

## Specification
Your task is to produce a reflection that address the points below. You may use any media source to create your reflection, you might make a video, write a poem or a song, write a program, draw a comic, write an essay, or something else you decide. You can use any medium you desire. Note: If you decide to write an essay, I am expecting about a page, single spaced.

Items to address (feel free to include other things, or expand on these items):
* What was the best thing you learned?
* What was your biggest contribution to the class?
* What were your strengths?
* What do you think you need more practice with?
* What is something related to programming that you hope to explore more in the future?
* How are you planning to use what you learned in your future?
* If you could take the class all over again knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?
