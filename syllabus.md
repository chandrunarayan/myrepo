[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2020_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava)

# CPJava Course Syllabus
## Catalog Information
__Course ID__: CPJava

__Course Title__: Interactive Digital Media Design

__Offering__: Spring Semester 2020

__Class__: Mon/ 11:10 – 12:40, Wed/ 9:30 – 10:10, Thu/ 1:40 – 3:10, WIS 204

__Prerequisites__: None

__Description__: Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Students will explore the essentials of Computer Programming including: cconditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to video games, installation art, and simulations of biological and social phenomena. We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web.

__Final__: No standard final, instead a final project. The Final Project will be assigned based on student skills _Diiferentiation_. For students following the standard curriculum, the final project will be team-based.  For those students following the Advanced curriculum, Final Project will be individual. These assignments will be discussed and finalized soon after returning from Winter break.

## Differentiation
This course is designed to accommodate students with differing pre-existing computing knowledge and future expectations for learning computer programming. The course exercises, homework, and projects will be assigned categories "required" and "advanced". Those stuents will be asked to choose their pathway ("required" or "advanced") though the curriculum at the beginning of the Semester. This choice will be recorded on the [Student Portfolio](student-work.md). The students will then proceed to complete their assignments and be evaluated according to this choice. 

## Grading

The grade weighting is as follows (irresective of student choice for differentiation):
* Student Portfolio (Classwork, Homework): 50%
* Final Project: 25%
* Participation: 25%

The programming assignments will include weekly individual and pair programming assignments, as well as your portfolio work to showcase your programming assignments.

For specific details on how code submisisons will be graded please refer to [Project Submission Specifications for Assessment](final-project.md)

### Participation
Your participation grade will include your scores on quizzes, your active participation in class, as well as your participation on Google Classroom. We expect students to come to class with relevant ideas, and questions related to the class topics.

We expect  students to be active participants in the learning process. The questions below are designed to help guide you.
* Do you make at least one excellent contribution (e.g., insight or question) to each class without monopolizing discussion?
* Do you give active nonverbal and verbal feedback?
* Do you refer to other students by name and react to their contributions?

#### Punctuality
We expect all students to arrive on time to class except for in cases of emergency. 

### Late Work
Late work is not accepted unless under special circumstances. If you need to turn in an assignment late under special circumstances, please email the instructor to schedule a meeting in which we can discuss and determine if extra time is needed.

## Academic Conduct
All work in this class must be your own. Copying code from other students is strictly prohibited and will defeat the purpose of taking this class. We expect you to produce original work to the best of your abilities. However, we encourage you to use online resources to learn how to achieve new things, but we expect you to use these resources to learn to write your own code, rather than copying code you find online directly and submitting it as your own work. When using online work citations are a requirement - see below.

### Academic Integrity
The essence of academic life revolves around respect not only for the ideas of others, but also their rights to those ideas. It is therefore essential that all of us engaged in the life of the mind take the utmost care that the ideas and expressions of ideas of other people always be appropriately handled, and, where necessary, cited. When ideas or materials of others are used, they must be cited. The format is not that important—as long as the source material can be located and the citation verified, it's OK. What is important is that the material be cited. In any situation, if you have a question, please feel free to ask. Please acquaint yourself with the Bush School resources on academic honesty.

### Copyright
All of the expressions of ideas in this class that are fixed in any tangible medium such as digital and physical documents are protected by copyright law as embodied in title 17 of the United States Code. These expressions include the work product of both: (1) your student colleagues (e.g., any assignments published here in the course environment or statements committed to text in a discussion forum); and, (2) your instructors (e.g., the syllabus, assignments, reading lists, and lectures). Within the constraints of "fair use," you may copy these copyrighted expressions for your personal intellectual use in support of your education here in the UW. Such fair use by you does not include further distribution by any means of copying, performance or presentation beyond the circle of your close acquaintances, student colleagues in this class and your family. If you have any questions regarding whether a use to which you wish to put one of these expressions violates the creator's copyright interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.

### Privacy
To support an academic environment of rigorous discussion and open expression of personal thoughts and feelings, we, as members of the academic community, must be committed to the inviolate right of privacy of our student and instructor colleagues. As a result, we must forego sharing personally identifiable information about any member of our community including information about the ideas they express, their families, lifestyles and their political and social affiliations. If you have any questions regarding whether a disclosure you wish to make regarding anyone in this course or in the Bush School community violates that person's privacy interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.
