## Trinket Exercises
* [Java Intro](JavaBasics.html)

Welcome to the Bush School Computer Programming in Java (CPJava) class. You might jave written programs before in some language like Scratch, Python, or Javascript. In many ways Java programming is similar, but you will notice immediately that even a basic Java "Hello, World!" program looks pretty confusing and complicated. Here's a Java program that prints "Hello, You!". Press the Run button and the program output should appear to the right of the code in the Result in what is called the console where the output from Java code appears.  Try editing the code in the left side to change the output to say Hello to your name (instead of You) and press the Run button.
